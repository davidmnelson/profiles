# Profiles
These are some of my mobileconfig profiles for Apple operating systems. 

## ChromeSecuritySettings.mobileconfig ##
Google Chrome: Disables form autofill, password viewing/saving, prevents changes to proxy settings, and blacklists all but a handful of Chrome extensions.

## PrintFooterWithHardwareAddress.mobileconfig ##
Printing: Forces footer with username, date/time, and MAC address on all print jobs. Useful for tracking abuse/over-use of printers.
